There are "flags".
i - insensitive, looks for both uppercase and lowercase strings.
g - global, looks for all the occurrences of an expression.
^ - Looks for the expression in the start of the string. (^testing)
$ - Looks for the expression in the end of the string. (testing$)
| - Works as OR, finding the expression before AND after the pipe (a|b).
+ - Looks for all the occurrences in sequence of the expression. (a+) Looks for all letter 'a' in sequence from a string.
. - Any other character that follows the expression (a. in 'Testing an event', takes 'an').
\ - Escape the expression to use special caracters ( \(..\) )
\w - Used to find any alphanumeric character.
\W - Is the inverse of \w, takes any non-alphanumeric character.
